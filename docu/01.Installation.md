# Installation

This tutorial is about how to install and run MySaaS in either

1. your development environment, and
2. your production environment.

Outline:

2. [Fork MySaaS](#2-fork-mysaas)
3. [Database Installation](#3-configuration-file)
4. [Configuration File](#4-test-database-connection)
5. [Test Database Connection](#5-run-database-migrations)
6. [Run Database Migrations](#6-run-the-app)
7. [Run the App](#7-running-on-production)
8. [Running on Production](#7-running-on-production)

## 1. Setup Environment

MySaaS has been developed and tested on the following environment:
- Ubuntu 20.04
- Ruby 3.1.2
- Bundler 2.3.7

The command below install such an environment in your computer.

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leandrosardi/my.saas/main/cli/install.sh
bash install.sh
```

## 2. Fork MySaaS

Create your own repository, using this one as a template.

1. Access your GitHub account, and click on "Create fork".

2. Go [here](https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas/fork) to fork this repository.

3. Clone the project in your computer.

```bash
mkdir ~/code
cd ~/code
git clone https://github.com/<your github user>/my.saas
```

4. Install requrired gems

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas
bundler update
```

## 3. Database Installation

MySaaS runs on CockroachDB. 

Here are the instructions for installing the database in either: development or production environments:

- For creating a database for development in your local computer, refer to this [tutorial](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/docs/stable/install-cockroachdb-linux) to install CockroachDB locally.

Then run it as stand-alone with the command below:

```bash
cockroach start-single-node --insecure
```

- For creating cloud and serverless database for production, refer to [this tutorial](./docu/01.Installing-crdb.md) for:

	1. Creating your free-tier CockroachDB instance;
	2. Setting up your connection on `config.rb`; and
	3. Deploying all database migrations.

## 4. Configuration File

First, you need a configuration file:

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas
cp ./config.template.rb ./config.rb
```

In such a configuration file, your database connection parameters:

```ruby
BlackStack::CRDB::set_db_params({ 
  :db_url => 'free-tier14.aws-us-east-1.cockroachlabs.cloud',
  :db_port => '26257', 
  :db_cluster => 'blackstack-4545', # this parameter is optional. Use this when using CRDB serverless.
  :db_name => 'blackstack', 
  :db_user => 'blackstack', 
  :db_password => '(write your db password here)',
})
```

## 5. Test Database Connection

```bash
export RUBYLIB=~/code/my.saas
cd ~/code/mysaas/cli
ruby conn.rb
```

## 6. Run Database Migrations

The CLI command `deploy.rb` can run such installation, and any further database migration.

```bash
export RUBYLIB=~/code/my.saas
cd ~/code/mysaas/cli
ruby deploy.rb db=yes web=no
```

The parameter `web=no` means you don't want to pull the last version of MySaaS and run the web server on production.

By default, both parameters, `db` and `web` are `yes`.

## 7. Run the App

After you have MySaaS configured to connect to CockroachDB, and all the database migrations installed, you can put your SaaS online.

Before running the `app` command, you need to edit the environment variable `$RUBYLIB`.

```bash
export RUBYLIB=~/code/my.saas
```

Then, you are good to run your app.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/
ruby app.rb
```

Now, you go to [https://127.0.0.1:3000](https://127.0.0.1:3000) and access the platform account with the default credentials for the **system owner**:
- email: su
- password: Testing123

If you want to use another file different than `config.rb`, use the `config` parameter.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas
ruby app.rb config=my_config
```

If you want to use another port different than `3000`, use the `port` parameter.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas
ruby app.rb port=8080
```

## 8. Running on Production

Refer to this tutorial about how to setup an Elastic Server on AWS:

- [Installing AWS](./docu/1.installing-aws.md)


Refer to this other tutorial about how to deploy from your local computer to AWS.
