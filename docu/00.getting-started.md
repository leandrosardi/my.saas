# User Screens

This tutorial is a very simple example on how you can create a new SaaS with 1 screen to manage users.

## Reactive Components

Any **reactive component** changes its inner value when the linked value into the database changes too.

```html
<!-- defining a reactive element -->
<span class='reactive sp500'>{sp500}</span>

<script>
  // define a poll for updating .reactive elements with class. account, 
  // taking data from the access point /ajax/account.json, every 5 seconds.
  reactive_poll('sp500', '/ajax/sp500.json', 5);
</script>
```

The access point `/ajax/sp500.json` already exists in the source code of **my.saas**.
You can always write your custom access points. 

## Custom Access Points

In the `app.rb` file you can define new entries of custom access points you want to develop.

E.g.:

```ruby
_(pending)_
```

## Input Fields

_(pending)_

## Tables 

_(pending)_
