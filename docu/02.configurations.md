## 1. Sandbox

Create a file `.sandbox` to get the function `BlackStack.sandbox?` returning `true`.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas
touch .sandbox
```

The `BlackStack.sandbox?` function is used in the `config.rb` file mainly, switching configuration between `development` and `production` environments.

E.g.: You may want to switch between `development` and `production` databases without have to move files or writing code. Just keep the `.sandbox` file in your local computer for development.

```ruby
BlackStack::CRDB::set_db_params({ 
  :db_url => BlackStack.sandbox? ? '127.0.0.1' : '<serverless instance IP here>', 
  :db_port => '26257', 
  :db_cluster => BlackStack.sandbox? ? nil : '<serverless cluster ID here>', # this parameter is optional. Use this when using CRDB serverless.
  :db_name => 'freeleadsdata', 
  :db_user => 'root', 
  :db_password => '',
  :db_sslmode => BlackStack.sandbox? ? 'disable' : 'verify-full',
})
```

The state of the `.sanbox` flag is shown when you start the web server.

The state of the `.sandbox` flag is shown in the footer of the website too.

Note the `.sandbox` file is included in the [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas/blob/main/.gitignore) file, so it will never be pushed into the repository accidentally.
