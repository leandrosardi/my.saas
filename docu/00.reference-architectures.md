# Reference Architectures

There are 3 architectures your can implement when develop on my.saas.

1. the **stand-alone** architecture,
2. the **distributed database** architecture; and
3. the **master-slave-worker** architecture.

**Outline:**

_TODO: write a link to each subtiles. Use the subtitle number as a bullet. Don't include the subtitle number inside the link_

## 1. Stand-Aline Database Architecture

_TODO: write a short description about a stand alone architecture_

## 2. My.SaaS Stack

_TODO: introduce the picture below, explaing the subyascent stack under a mysaas implementation_

## 3. Extensiblity

_TODO: introduce the picture below, explaing the **extensions** you can add to a mysaas implementation, including an extension called "account" where you develop your product and attach it as an extension_

## 4. Pre-Built Extensions

_TODO: introduce the picture below, that shows the full list of pre-built mysaas extensions_

## 5. Distributed Database Architecture

The **distributed database** architecture consists on connecting my.saas to a serverless database instance of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).

This architecure has the following adventages:

- You can boundle all your data in one single databse instance.
- You don't have to deal with database servers.

## 6. Master-Slave-Worker Architecture.
