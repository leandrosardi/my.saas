# Reference Architectures

There are 3 architectures your can implement when develop on my.saas.

1. the **stand-alone** architecture,
2. the **distributed database** architecture; and
3. the **master-slave-worker** architecture.

**Outline:**

1. [Stand-Alone Architecture](#1-stand-aline-architecture)
2. [My.SaaS Stack](#2-mysaas-stack)
3. [My.SaaS Extensions](#3-extensiblity)
4. [Reference Architecture: Distributed-Database](#4-pre-built-extensions)
5. [Reference Architecture: Master-Slave-Worker](#5-distributed-database-architecture)
6. [High-Level Architecture](#6-master-slave-worker-architecture)

## 1. Stand-Aline Architecture

![MySaaS Stand-Alone Architecture](/docu/thumbnails/reference-architectures/1.png)

In the Stand-Alone architecture, all My.SaaS components are deployed on a single server, running locally. This configuration is ideal for small-scale applications or development environments, where simplicity and low overhead are key.

## 2. My.SaaS Stack

The stack represented in the picture belows illustrates the underlying technologies that power a My.SaaS implementation. It includes the following components:

- Nginx 1.18: A high-performance web server responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static and dynamic content.

- Sinatra / Puma: Sinatra is a lightweight Ruby web framework, while Puma is a concurrent web server designed for running Ruby/Rack applications, ensuring efficient request handling.

- BlackStack Framework: A custom framework tailored specifically for My.SaaS, providing the core application logic and structure.

- Ruby 3.1.2: The programming language used for developing the My.SaaS application, known for its simplicity and productivity.

- PostgreSQL 12.20: A powerful, open-source relational database management system, used to store and manage application data.

- Ubuntu 20.04: The operating system on which the entire stack runs, providing a stable and secure environment.

This stack forms the foundation of the My.SaaS platform, enabling it to deliver a reliable and scalable service.

## 3. Extensiblity

_TODO: introduce the picture below, explaing the **extensions** you can add to a mysaas implementation, including an extension called "account" where you develop your product and attach it as an extension_

## 4. Pre-Built Extensions

_TODO: introduce the picture below, that shows the full list of pre-built mysaas extensions_

## 5. Distributed Database Architecture

The **distributed database** architecture consists on connecting my.saas to a serverless database instance of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).

This architecure has the following adventages:

- You can boundle all your data in one single databse instance.
- You don't have to deal with database servers.

## 6. Master-Slave-Worker Architecture.
