# Reference Architectures

There are 2 architectures your can implement when develop on my.saas.

1. the **distributed database** architecture, and
2. the **master-slave-worker** architecture.

## Distributed Database Architecture

The **distributed database** architecture consists on connecting my.saas to a serverless database instance of [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/).
