# Secret Files Management

Every project has information that you don't want to push to the repository.

E.g.:
- passwords,
- ssl certificates. 

MySaaS connects to [DropBox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/reference/developer-guide) for automated backup and restoration of secret files.

Outline:

1. [The `.gitignore` File](#1-the-gitignore-file)
2. [Connecting to DropBox](#2-connecting-your-dropbox-account)
3. [Defining Files to BackUp](#3-defining-files-to-backup)
4. [Backing Up Files](#4-backing-up-files)
5. [Defining Files to BackUp](#5-restoring-files)
6. [Additional: Creating Your Own DropbBox App](#6-additional-creating-your-own-dropbbox-app)

## 1. The `.gitignore` File

The [`.gitignore`](https://github.com/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/main/.gitignore) is well configured to skip:

- [The `config.rb`](https://github.com/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/1.1.0/.gitignore#L31),
- [Domain SSL Certificates](https://github.com/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/1.1.0/.gitignore#L20),
- [Any `.log` file](https://github.com/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/1.1.0/.gitignore#L63),

When working on your own fork of MySaaS, always be sure to add any other secret files to the `.gitignore`.

## 2. Connecting Your DropBox Account

MySaaS uses the [BlackStack's DropBox Library](https://github.com/leandrosardi/my-dropbox-api) for connecting and operate DropBox.

Follow the steps below to connect your DropBox account:

1. Open a new browser, and login to your DropBox account.

2. In the same browser, go to this link:
https://www.dropbox.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=lnystcoayzse5at&token_access_type=offline&response_type=code

3. Follow the steps, and copy the "Access Code" to your clipboard.

Since Dropbox's "Access Codes" are short-term lived, you need to generate a "Refresh Token".
We have published a helper called **DropBox Storage Service** (or simply **DSS**) page where you can get such a Refresh Token.

You have to signup to ConnectionSphere to access **DSS**.

4. Signup to [ConnectionSphere](https://ConnectionSphere.com/signup).

5. Go to [DSS screen](https://connectionsphere.com/developers/dss), and follow the steps there:

7. Also, you have to generate your **API key for ConnectionSphere** (or simply **CS API Key**) [here](https://connectionsphere.com/settings/apikey).

8. Then, setup such a **Refresh Token** and **CS API Key** in your `config.rb`, in order to allow MySaaS to generate a new "Access Code" every time it needs.

```ruby
# Reference: https://github.com/leandrosardi/my-dropbox-api
BlackStack::DropBox.set({
    # your ConnectionSphere API Key
    :vymeco_api_key => '4ab*******',
    # your DropBox Refresh Token
    :dropbox_refresh_token => 'h6wR************-*********************',
})
```

## 3. Defining Files to BackUp

Define a constant `CODE_PATH`. Such a constant will be different you are working on development or production environments.

```ruby
# CODE_PATH may be different in production and development environments.
CODE_PATH = BlackStack.sandbox? ? '/home/leandro/code/freeleadsdata' : '/home/ubuntu/code/freeleadsdata'
```

Write a hash descriptor with the list of file(s) you want to upload to DropBox.

```ruby
BlackStack::BackUp.set({
    # different cloud folders to upload differt local folders 
    :bucket => [{
      # configuration file.
      :name => 'mysaas-configuration',
      # drop box folder where to store this backup
      :folder => 'freeleadsdata.app',
      # must be absolute paths
      :path => "#{CODE_PATH}/app",
      # pattern of files to find in the :path_origin
      :files => ['config.rb'],
    }, {
      # certification file for connecting serverless CockroackDB.
      :name => 'postgres-certificate',
      :folder => 'freeleadsdata.app',
      :path => "~/.postgresql",
      :files => ['root.crt'],
    }, {
      # certificate to connect AWS instances.
      :name => 'aws-certificate',
      :folder => 'freeleadsdata.app',
      :path => "#{CODE_PATH}/my.saas/cli",
      :files => ['fld.pem'],
    }, {
      # database deploying .lock files for SQL migrations
      :name => 'deploying-lockfiles',
      :folder => 'freeleadsdata.app',
      :path => "#{CODE_PATH}/my.saas/cli",
      :files => [
        'my-ruby-deployer.lock', 
        'my-ruby-deployer.i2p.lock', 
        'my-ruby-deployer.monitoring.lock',
        'my-ruby-deployer.content.lock',
      ],
    }, {
      # SSL certificaties.
      :name => 'ssl-Certificates',
      :folder => 'freeleadsdata.app',
      :path => "#{CODE_PATH}/my.saas/ssl",
      :files => ['prod.crt', 'prod.key'],
    }]
})
```

## 4. Backing Up Files

Use the CLI command `backup.rb` to upload your files to DropBox.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby backup.rb
```

In your DropBox accounts, find your uploaded files here: [https://www.dropbox.com/home/Apps/mysaas-backup](https://www.dropbox.com/home/Apps/mysaas-backup).

## 5. Restoring Files

Use the CLI command `restore.rb` to download your files from DropBox.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby restore.rb
```

## 6. Additional: Creating Your Own DropbBox App

For conncecting DropBox API

1. Signup to DropBox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/register) or login to an existing account [here](https://www.dropbox.com/login).

2. Go to your DropBox's account home [here](https://www.dropbox.com/home), and double-check you are logged into.

3. Go to [DropBox Developers Center](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/).

4. Click on the "Create app" button.

5. In the step 1 (Choose an API), choose "Scoped access".

6. In the step 2 (Choose the type of access you need), choose "App folder".

7. In the step 3 (Name your app), write "mysaas-backup".

8. Agree with the "Dropbox API Terms and Conditions", and click on "Create app".

You will be redirected to your new app's configuration page.
If you didn't, just go to [https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps) in your browser.

Now, you have to setup your app's permissions.

9. Click on the "Permissions" tab.

10. Check the "files.metadata.write", "files.content.write" and "files.content.read" options.

11. Scroll down and click on "Submit".

Finally, you have to grab your API key.

12. In the same screen, go to the "Settings".

13. Scroll down click on "Generate access token". Save such an **access token** in your notedpad.

14. In your `config.rb` file, edit the BackUps serction, for accessing DropBox with your access tocken, and backup the `config.rb` file.

```ruby
BlackStack::BackUp.set({
    :dropbox_refresh_token => '<past your access token here>',
    # different cloud folders to upload differt local folders 
    :bucket => [{
      # configuration file.
      :folder => 'config',
      :source => '/home/leandro/code/mysaas/config.rb',
    }]
})
```
