# SSL Certificates Installation and Reissuing

Before starting, you need to have a domain and email account under such a domain.
If you don't have them yet, refer to [this other tutorial](./01.setting-dimain-and-email) first.

If you already configured your domain and email account, here is a list of the different types of SSL certificates.

There are 3 technical types of SSL certificates we provide:

1. single-domain certificates – cover only 1 domain/subdomain name and its www subdomain;

2. multi-domain certificate – can secure three domain names for the original price. Overall, the certificate can secure up to 100 domain names (Please note that domain.com and www.domain.com are considered different domain names and need to be added separately.), 97 of them require additional payment;

3. wildcard certificates – can secure one domain name and all its one-level subdomains.

There is not an automated way to add domains to a multi-domain certificate. The process is manual, unfortunately.

Extra domains can be added only during the reissue process as is explained [here](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9282/2221/can-i-add-another-domain-later-after-the-ssl-certificate-has-been-issued-and-activated).

## 1. Buying an SSL

Reference: [Steps to get the SSL certificate activated](https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/794/67/how-do-i-activate-an-ssl-certificate/).

1. Access to your NameCheap account.

2. Go [here](https://www.namecheap.com/security/ssl-certificates/) and buy PositiveSSL for $5.99/year.

## 2. Creating Cerificates

1. Generate a CSR code for your domain. Use [this tool](https://decoder.link/csr_generator] for doing that.

2. Download 3 files: `yourdimain.csr`, `yourdomain.key` and `yourdomain.crt`, in the `/ssl` folder of your MySaaS project.

![SSL Files](./thumbnails/ssl-files.png)

The .CRT is useless, because it is not trusted by browsers.
Instead, you should use the SSL certificate that you received from the Certificate Authority.

3. Go [here](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/ProductList/SslCertificates) to find the SSL cerificate that you just purchased.

4. Click on **Activate**, and follow the steps to verify you own the domain.

5. Go [here](https://ap.www.namecheap.com/ProductList/SslCertificates) again, and verify your new SSL is **active**.

And you will receive an email with the certificates to install in your website too.

6. Download the `.zip` file from the email, and extract the files in the `./ssl` folder of your MySaaS project.

2. Click on Services > Compute > EC2 > Load Balancers to select your load balancer from the navigation pane.

3. On the Listeners tab, click on Edit and then select Add and for the protocol choose HTTPS.

4. Under the SSL certificate option, click on Change and from the Certificate type list choose the Upload a new SSL certificate to AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) option.
