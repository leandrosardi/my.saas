# Deployment

Deployment routines are used for both:

1. Installing environment into a new server; 
2. Installing/Upgrade source code into a servers;
3. Stop processes into a server; and
4. Starting processes into a server.

Pre-defined routines are:

- `install-environment`
- `install-source-code`
- `stop`
- `start`

1. [Defining Nodes](#1-defining-nodes)
2. [Defining Routines](#2-defining-routines)
3. [Managing Private Repositories](#3-managing-private-repositories)
4. [Testing Routines](#4-testing-routines)
5. [Running Deployment](#5-running-deployment)
6. [Starting and Stopping Processes](#6-starting-and-stopping-processes)

## 1. Defining Nodes

In your `config.rb` file, setup your nodes like is shown in the code below:

```ruby
# declare production nodes.
# .BlackStack.sandbox? flag doesn't play here.
# both cs.pem file and config.rb file are always taken from the local dev machine (leandro).
BlackStack::Deployer::add_nodes([{
    # use this command to connect from terminal: ssh -i 'cs.pem' ubuntu@ec2-34-234-83-88.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    :name => 'web', 
    
    # SSH connnection parameters
    :net_remote_ip => '54.157.239.98',  
    :ssh_username => 'ubuntu',
    :ssh_port => 22,

    ## SSH Password is not used. Use key file instead.
    ## Key file is stored in my local computer.
    #:ssh_password => ssh_password, 
    :ssh_private_key_file => '/home/leandro/code/my.saas/cli/cs.pem',

    # content of config.rb file in my local computer
    :config_rb_content => File.read('/home/leandro/code/my.saas/config.rb'),

    # git branch & credentials, used to access private repositories
    # 
    # Since remote authentication with password has been removed on GitHub, you have to create an authentication token. 
    # reference: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens
    # 
    :git_branch => 'main',
    :git_username => 'leandrosardi',
    :git_password => '****',
    
    # code folder into the production server, where to pull the source code
    :code_folder => '~/code/my.saas',

    # default deployment routine for this node
    :deployment_routine => 'deploy-webserver',
}])
```

You can also define custom parameters that can be replaced in your Bash scripts during execution time.

For example, you may want to define the port where the web server will be listening.

```ruby
BlackStack::Deployer::add_nodes([{
    # use this command to connect from terminal: ssh -i 'cs.pem' ubuntu@ec2-34-234-83-88.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    :name => 'web', 
    
    ...

    # sinatra
    :web_port => 3000,
}])
```

## 2. Defining Routines

Define a routine with your bash script:

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir ~/code
            git clone https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas ~/code
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

As a good practice, your bash script should re-run with no error: 

- The `mkdir ~/code` will return `File exists` error if you run a second time, so you should replace it by `mkdir ~p code`

- The `git clone` line will return `Already exists` error too, so you should replace it by `git clone ... >/dev/null 2>&1`

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir -p ~/code
            git clone https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas %code_folder% >/dev/null 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

As another good practice, you should store the output of all commands into a text file.

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir -p ~/code >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git clone https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas %code_folder% >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

Finally, you want this routine to not only install source code, but also download new versions

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir -p ~/code >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git clone https://github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas %code_folder% >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            cd %code_folder%
            git fetch --all >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git reset --hard origin/main >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

## 3. Managing Private Repositories

If you are managing a private repository, you need to use the git user/password that you configured for your node.
Grab such user/password from the node descriptor using variables `%git_user%` and `%git_password%`.

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir -p ~/code >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git clone https://%git_user%:%git_password%@github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas %code_folder% >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

Since remote authentication with password has been removed on GitHub, you have to create an authentication token. Refer to [this document](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens) to learn how to generate our authentication token.


Since the repository is private, you have to make **Git** remember your credentials for further `fetch` operations.

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'deploy-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            mkdir -p ~/code >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git clone https://%git_user%:%git_password%@github.com/leandrosardi/my.saas %code_folder% >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            git config --global credential.helper store >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

## 4. Testing Routines

In your local environment, run the command below in order to:

1. Connect a node; and
2. Execute a routine.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb nodes=web routine=deploy-webserver
```

## 5. Running Deployment

The command `deploy.rb` with no parameters will connect each one of the nodes defined, and execute the routine defined in `:deployment_routine`.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb
```

## 6. Starting and Stopping Processes

Starting or stopping processes is just another routine.

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'start-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            # kill all my.saas + puma processes, except grep processes
            ps ax | grep \"my.saas\" | grep \"puma\" | grep -v grep | cut -b1-7 | xargs -t kill -9 >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
            # setup environment
            export RUBYLIB=%code_folder%
            cd %code_folder%
            # run webserver in backgroun mode (& at the end of the command)
            ruby $HOME/code/freeleadsdata/micro.data/app.rb port=%web_port%  >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1 &
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

The routine for stopping is more simple.

```ruby
# setup deploying rutines
BlackStack::Deployer::add_routine({
  :name => 'stop-webserver',
    :commands => [
      { :command => "
            # kill all my.saas + puma processes, except grep processes
            ps ax | grep \"my.saas\" | grep \"puma\" | grep -v grep | cut -b1-7 | xargs -t kill -9 >>~/mysaas-deploy.output 2>&1
        "        
      },
  ],
});
```

You can run the `start-webserver` routine for all nodes with name matching with `web`

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb nodes=web routine=start-webserver
```
