## 8. Email Notifications

For every **notification** that you want to setup, you have to create a file in the folder `notifications` of your **MySaaS**'s extension. 

The **Notifications** module of **MySaaS** has the following features:

1. [Setting Notification](#81-setting-notification).
2. [Delivering Trigger Notifications](#82-delivering-trigger-notifications).
3. [Delivering FollowUp Notifications](#83-delivering-followup-notifications).
4. [Testing FollowUp Conditions](#84-testing-followup-conditions).
5. [Delivering Test Emails](#85-delivering-test-emails).
6. [Tracking Opens](#86-tracking-opens).
7. [Tracking Clicks](#87-tracking-clicks).

### 8.1. Setting Notification

For every **notification** that you want to setup, you have to create a file in the folder `notifications` of your **MySaaS**'s extension. 

Example: the file `~/code/my.saas/notifications/confirm.rb` has this code.

```ruby
# Notification to deliver when a new user signups, or a new user is added to an exisitng account.
module BlackStack
  module MySaaS
    class NotificationConfirm < BlackStack::MySaaS::Notification 
      LINK_TIMEOUT = 18

      def initialize(i_user)
        super(i_user)
        self.type = 2
      end
      
      def subject_template
        "Confirm Your Email Address."
      end

      def body_template
        " 
          <p>Dear #{self.user.name.encode_html},</p>

          <p>We sent this email to you becuase you created an account in <a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}'><b>#{APP_NAME}</b></a>.</p>

          <p><b>Click the link below to confirm your email address.</b></p>
          
          <p>This link will be valid for #{BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm::LINK_TIMEOUT.to_s} minutes.</p>
          
          <p><a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}/confirm/#{self.id.to_guid}'><b>Click here and confirm your email address</b></a>.</p>
          
          <br/>
          
          <p>Email address confirmation is a neccesary step to unlock most of the #{APP_NAME} features.</p>
          <p>If the link above is no longer available, you can request a new confirmation link <a href='#{CS_HOME_WEBSITE}/settings/users'><b>here</b></a>.</p>
        "
      end
    end
  end # module MySaaS
end # module BlackStack
```

### 8.2. Delivering Trigger Notifications

A **trigger notification** happens when the user performs any specific action.

Examples:

- When the user signups, you send him a welcome email.

- When the user request a report, you send him an email with a link for email address verification.
(Our native class `NotificationConfirm` does that).

To delivering **trigger notifications** you just have to add a line in your source code, just where there trigger event happens.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm.new(u).do
```

### 8.3. Delivering FollowUp Notifications

A **followup notification** is more like a marketing email that you deliver to remind the user to take some action.

Example:

- You send a weekly email about new seminars in your education platform.

- You send a daily email with a summary of new posts of fellow community members.

A **followup notification** can be setting in `config.rb` file of your **MySaaS**'s extension.

```ruby
# When client has accounts, but 0 pipelines created.
# This happens very often when a client paid for service, we assigned accounts, but the client didn't submit his requirement.
BlackStack::MySaaS::Notifications.add_followup({
    'name' => 'leads.didnt-create-search',
    'description' => "New account signed up, but it did't create a any search yet.",
    # what is the notification to deliver
    'notification' => BlackStack::Leads::NotificationNoSearch
    # what is the condition to deliver this notification to a user.
    'condition' => Proc.new do |user, *args|
        # use must be the owner of the account
        object.lnusers.size > 0 &&
        object.pipelines.size == 0 
    end,
    # how ofter should I repeat this process.
    'repeat_notification' => true, 
    'repeat_notification_units' => 1,
    'repeat_notification_period' => 'day', 
    'repeat_times' => -1, # -1: repeat forever, 0: never deliver, >0: stop after # notifications.  
})
```

### 8.4. Testing FollowUp Conditions

The command below will test the condition of each follow, for all the active users; and it will return a report about this. 

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby ./followups.rb
```

If you want to test one specific followup, use the parameter `name=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb name=leads.didnt-create-search
```

If you want to test for one specific user, use the parameter `email=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb email=leandro.sardi@expandedventure.com
```

If you also want to deliver such a followups, use the parameter `do=`

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb do=yes
```

### 8.5. Delivering Test Emails

If you want to send a test followup email to your inbox, use the same commanad `followups.rb` with the parameters `test=` and `to=`.

```bash
ruby ./followups.rb test=yes to=leandro.sardi@expandedventure.com
```

Such a command will use the first followup to deliver in the list of pendings.

If there is no pending followup to deliver, it will use the latest delivered followup.

### 8.6. Tracking Opens

When you send a notification, **MySaaS** automatically adds a pixel image to track opens.

You can disable such a pixel when you deliver a **trigger notification**.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm.new(u, :track_opens=>false).do
```

You can disable it for **followup notifications** too.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::Notifications.add_followup({
    'name' => 'leads.didnt-create-search',
    'track_opens' => false,
    # ...
})
```

### 8.7. Tracking Clicks

When you send a notification, **MySaaS** automatically replaces any link with a tracking-link.

You can disable such a feature when you deliver a **trigger notification**.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::NotificationConfirm.new(u, :track_clicks=>false).do
```

You can disable it for **followup notifications** too.

```ruby
BlackStack::MySaaS::Notifications.add_followup({
    'name' => 'leads.didnt-create-search',
    'track_clicks' => false,
    # ...
})
```
