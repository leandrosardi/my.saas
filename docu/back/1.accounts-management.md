# 1. Accounts Manangerment

Once you have installed your local environment and accessed the platform there, you can start testing many commons accounts' use cases like signup or login.

Here are each one of the use cases supported by **MySaaS** natively.

## 1.1. user signup

Any user can signup in this path:

```
http://127.0.0.1/signup
```

You can also signup a new user with this ruby code:

```ruby
# load gem and connect database
require 'sinatra'
require 'mysaas.rb'
require 'config'
require 'version'
DB = BlackStack.db_connect
require 'models/orm'
# signup a new account
BlackStack::MySaaS::Account::signup(
    :companyname => 'name of your company', 
    :username => 'your name',
    :email => 'your@email.com', 
    :password => 'your.password123',
    :phone => '555-5555'
)
```

Password are crypyed by using [BCrypt](https://github.com/bcrypt-ruby/bcrypt-ruby).

## 1.7. account files storage 

Every account has a dedicated folder in `/public/clients`.

You can find a code like this in `config.rb`. Such a code setup the configuration of the accounts storage.

```ruby
# setting up storage configuration
BlackStack::Storage::set_storage(
  :storage_folder => SANDBOX ? '/home/leandro/code/mysaas/public/clients' : '/home/ubuntu/code/mysaas/public/clients',
  :storage_default_max_allowed_kilobytes => 15 * 1024,
  :storage_sub_folders => [
    'downloads', 'uploads', 'logs'
  ],
)
# => nil
```

It is important you write absolute paths in the key `:storage_folder`, because the source code uses to be installed by the `blackstack` user, but the webserver may be started by `root`.


For any instance of `BlackStack::MySaaS::Account` you can grab some information about its storage.

**Example:**

```ruby
# loading an account
a = BlackStack::MySaaS::Account.first
# => nil

puts "Storage Folder: #{a.storage_folder}"
# => Storage Folder: /home/leandro/code/mysaas/public/clients/897B4C5E-692E-400F-BC97-8EE0E3E1F1CF

puts "List of Sub-Folders that Every Account Should Have: #{BlackStack::Storage::storage_sub_folders.join(', ')}"
# => List of Sub-Folders that Every Account Should Have: downloads, uploads, logs
```


You can add new folders to the storage configuration at any moment.

The code below creates all the folders and sub-folders who not exists.

```ruby
a.create_storage
# => nil
```


Since any account has a quota of disk space for his/her storage folder, you can check such a quota at any moment.

```ruby
puts "Used KBs: #{a.storage_used_kb}"
# => 0

puts "Free KBs: #{a.storage_free_kb}"
# => 15360
```

## 1.8. user preferences

**User preferences** helps you to store the user behaviour in the database in order to grab such an information later, even if the `session` hash has been lost. Example: the filters applied on a screen, or the sort column and order for a table.

**Example:**

```ruby
# loading a user, who is not deleted
u = BlackStack::MySaaS::User.where(:delete_time => nil).first
# => nil

# setting up a new preference
name = 'default-marketplace-section' # name of the preference
default = 'cellphones' # set this when `value.nil?`
value = 'bikes'
u.preference(name, default, value)
# => bikes
```

**User preferences** is a good tool for

1. profiling users for further segmentation to take decisions about marketing or user experience designs;
and
2. improve the user experience by remembering the filters, sortings, and other configuration frequently used by users.


When you receive the `params` hash with the GET parameters received by a page, you can easily update the user prefernces.

**Example:**

```ruby
# `params` is the hash of GET parameters received by a page.
# user preferences regarding the sorting
order_column = @login.user.preference('settings.users.order.column', 'name', params[:column])
order_direction = @login.user.preference('settings.users.order.direction', 'asc', params[:direction])
```

You can also grab the value of any any preference.

**Example:**

```ruby
# getting a preference
puts u.preferences.select { |p| p.name=='settings.users.order.column' }.first.get_value
# => bikes
```
