## 13.1. Fixed Deployment

**Step 1:** Define the nodes in your `config.rb` file.

```ruby
# declare nodes
BlackStack::Deployer::add_nodes([{
    # use this command to connect from terminal: ssh -i 'plank.pem' ubuntu@ec2-34-234-83-88.compute-1.amazonaws.com
    :name => 'sinatra1',
 
    # ssh
    :net_remote_ip => '44.203.58.26',  
    :ssh_username => 'ubuntu',
    :ssh_port => 22,
    #:ssh_password => ssh_password,
    :ssh_private_key_file => './plank.pem',
 
    # git
    :git_branch => 'main',

    # name of the LAN interface
    :laninterface => 'eth0',

    # cockroachdb
    :crdb_hostname => '44.203.58.26',
    :crdb_database_certs_path => '/home/ubuntu',
    :crdb_database_password => 'bsws2022',
    :crdb_database_port => 26257,
    :crdb_dashboard_port => 8080,

    # sinatra
    :web_port => 81,

    # config.rb content from my local environment, to upload to production nodes
    :config_rb_content => File.read('./config.rb'),

    # default deployment routine for this node
    :deployment_routine => 'deploy-mysaas',
}])
```

**Step 2:** Run `deploy.rb` command.

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb
```

## 13.2. Deplyment Parameters

Bassically, such a `deploy.rb` command will run:
1. the updates to the database; and
2. the fetch/update if the website source code (including its gems).

If you want to run the update of the website source code only, you can skip the database update with the parameter `db=no`, as is snown in the example below:

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb db=no
```

If you want to run the updates of the database only, you can skip the website update with the parameter `web=no`, as is snown in the example below:

```bash
cd ~/code/my.saas/cli
ruby deploy.rb web=no
```

## 13.3. Elastic Deployment

Elastic Deployment is about deploy new source code where you are hosting MySaaS into any kind of **elastic cloud servers** like [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

_(pending - we have to develop SHM to get noticed of existing nodes)_


## 13.4. Deployment Sequence

The sequence of the `deploy.rb` command is the following:

1. Run the updates to the database, by running the pending `.sql` files.

2. Upload the **private files** (like `config.rb` or the ssl certificates).

3. Run `git` for fetching and updating of the website source code.

3. Run `git` for fetching and updating of the source code of each one of the [extensions](/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/main/docu/12.extensibility.md).

4. Restart the webserver.

5. Run the deployment routinces for each one of the extensions.
