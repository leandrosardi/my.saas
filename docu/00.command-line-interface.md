# Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI of my.saas provides the following features:

- Infrastructure as a Code (IaaC),
- Continious Deployment (CD),
- Processes Monitoring; and
- Infrastructure Monitoring.


## 1. The `saas` Command

The `saas` command simply receives the name of a Ruby **script** that you want to execute.

```
saas <ruby script filename>
```

The `saas` command will look for such a script into the folder specified in the environment variable `$SAASLIB`. 

If the script your call receives parameters, then you can add them.

```
saas <ruby script filename> <list of command line parameters>
```

Here is the list of scripts you can execute:

| script  | example                                       | description                                                                                                                                          |

## 2. Define Nodes

This is the IaaC part.

You can add a node to your infrastructure.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'master', 

    # If true, this node is belonging your development environment.
    # If true, ignore this node when deploying.
    # Optional. Default: false.
    :dev => false, 

    # Public Internet IP address of the node.
    # If `nil`, that means that no instance of a cloud server has been created yet for this node.
    # Optional. Default: `nil`.
    :net_remote_ip => nil,

    # Who is providing this node.
    # Allowed values: [:contabo].
    # Optional. Default: :contabo.
    :provider => :contabo,

    # What service is this.
    # If :provider is :contabo, allowed values are ['CLOUD VPS 1', 'CLOUD VPS 3', 'CLOUD VPS 6']
    # Mandatory.
    :service => 'CLOUD VPS 1',

    # Reference to another node where is hosted the database to work with.
    # Mandatory.
    :db_host => 'dev2',

    # SSH credentials.
    :ssh_username => 'blackstack',
    :ssh_port => 22,
    :ssh_password => '<write SSH password here>',

    # Root password is required to install the environment at the first time.
    :ssh_root_password => '<write SSH password here>',

    # Parameters to connect to the github repositories.
    #
    :git_repository => 'leandrosardi/my.saas',
    :git_branch => 'main', 
    :git_username => 'leandrosardi',
    # Instead of GitHub password, you have to provide an access token.
    # How to get a GitHub access token: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app 
    :git_password => '<your github access token>',
    
    # Folder into where you want to clone the repository defined in `git_repository`.
    # Mandatory.
    :code_folder => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',

    # List of processes to start
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :procs => {
        # list of commands to run when starting a node.
        :start => [
            {
                # the command you are executing must be located into `code_folder`.
                :command => 'app.rb port=3000',
                # where to redirect any output in the starting of this command.
                # note that the command may log into another file once it started.
                :stdout => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/app.log',
                :stderr => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',
                # value to assign to the environment variable `$RUBYLIB`
                :rubylib => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',
            }, {
                ...
            }
        ],
        # list of commands to kill when stopping a node.
        :stop => [
            'app.rb port=3000',
            'adspower',
            ...
        ],
    },

    # List of logfiles allowed to watch or monitor.
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :logs => [
        '/home/blackstack/code1/master/app.log',
        ... 
    ],

    # List of websites published on this node.
    # This is used for monitoring.
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :webs => [
        {
            # descriptive name of this website.
            :name => 'ruby-sinatra',
            # port this website is listening.
            :port => 3000,
            # protocol used. Allowed values are [:http, :https].
            :protocol => :http,
        }, {
            # descriptive name of this website.
            :name => 'nginx',
            # port this website is listening.
            :port => 443,
            # protocol used. Allowed values are [:http, :https].
            :protocol => :https,
        }
    ],
})
```

Note that if the hash descriptor passed to the `add_node` method has not the right format, of if there are missed parameters, or if there are unknown parameters; then such a method will raise an exception `Node hash descriptor mailformed.`

## 2. Create Nodes

You can create a new instance of a cloud server for any of the nodes you have defined.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.create :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas create nodes=master
```

- If the node has been already created, the command will raise an exception.

```
saas create nodes=master
Error: Command already created.
```

- You can also request the creation all nodes using regular expressions.

```
saas create nodes=*
```

- You can also request the creation some nodes by listing them separated by commas.

```
saas create nodes=master,slave01
```

- You can do both: listing many nodes, and using regular expressions in some elements of the list.

```
saas create nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 3. Release Node

If you have manually deleted the instance of a node from your hosting provider, you can update that your database.

The `release` script simply assign `nil` value to the field `net_remote_ip`.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.release :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas create nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 4. Install Environment

Install the my.saas envoronment into one node, by running the script `install.20.04.sh`.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.install :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas install nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 5. Deployment

This command will:

- pull the latest version of source code of my.saas from the branch specified in `git_branch`,

- pull the latest version of source code of each [extension](/docu/16.extensibility.md) specified in the `config.rb`, 

- run `bundler update`,

- execute all sql migrations in the folder `sql`,

- install SSL certification.


- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.deploy :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas deploy nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 6. Stop

Stop a specific process or all processes running into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 7. Start

Start a specific list of processes into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 8. Restart

Restart a specific list of process into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 9. Push Secrets

Submit the secret files `config.rb` from your local environment to your secret repository.

First thing first, you have to define what are your secrets.

E.g.:

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.set_secrets({
    # define your secret repository.
    :git_repository => 'leandrosardi/my.secrets',
    :git_branch => 'main', 
    :git_username => 'leandrosardi',
    # Instead of GitHub password, you have to provide an access token.
    # How to get a GitHub access token: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app 
    :git_password => '<your github access token>',

    # define your secret files.
    :secrets => [
        {
            # this is where you place the source code for the master node.
            #
            # representative name of this secret.
            :name => :master,
            # path in my local environment where this secret is placed.
            :path => 'home/leandro/code1/master/config.rb',
        }, {
            # this is where you place the source code for any slave node.
            #
            # representative name of this secret.
            :name => :slave,
            # path in my local environment where this secret is placed.
            :path => 'home/leandro/code1/slave/config.rb',
        }
    ]
})
```

Then,

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.push :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas push secrets=master,slave
```

Note that if the hash descriptor passed to the `set_secrets` method has not the right format, of if there are missed parameters, or if there are unknown parameters; then such a method will raise an exception `Secret hash descriptor mailformed.`

## 10. Pull Secrets

Download the secret files from your secret repository to your local environment.

## 11. Connect via SSH

Open a SSH connection to a specific node.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 12. Reboot

Reboot nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 13. Procs

Show list of processes defined for each node, and show which ones are running and which ones are not.

- You can do that by Ruby code and get a hash descriptor of the **state** of each process defined for a node.

The **state** of a process indicates if such a process is running or not:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.procs :master
# => [{ :proc => 'app.rb port=3000', running => true }]
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI, and watch a table that will update every 5 seconds by default:

```
saas push nodes=master

| proc             | running |
|------------------|---------|
| app.rb port=3000 | yes     |
```

- You can specify the interval to update the table:

```
saas procs secrets=master interval=10
```

- You can also specify the processes you want to watch using regular expression:

```
saas procs secrets=master procs=app
```

- Obviously, you can specify a list of many nodes and many processes to watch:

```
saas procs secrets=master,slave.* procs=app,import,timeline
```

## 14. Log

Watch one log of the ones defined for a nodes, and watch it.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 15. Stat

Watch the usage of CPU, memory, and disk space of each node if your infrastructure.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 16. Proxies

Show list of proxies defined for each node, and show which ones are running and which ones are not.

For using this feature, you have to define the proxies configured on a node.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # List of proxies installed.
    # Optional. Default: nil.
    :proxies => [
        # define username and password for all proxies.
        :default_username => 'proxy-user-01',
        :default_password => '<password for all proxies here>',
        # list of proxies.
        # Mandatory.
        :ports => [
            # you can define a specific port with specific credentials.
            { :numbers => 3000, :username => 'custom-user', :password => '<custom password>' },
            # you can define an array of ports that use default credentials.
            # note that you are converting a rnage into an array.
            { :numbers => [3001..3250].to_a },
        ]
    ]
})
```

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 18. SSL

Watch list of SSL certificates defined for each node, and they are working or not with no expiration.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 19. Alerts

When you define a node, you can setup the following alerts:

- if CPU usage is over a threshold,
- if memory usage is over a threshold,
- if disk usage is under a threshold,
- if a log file contains certain strings or string patterns,
- if a process is not running,
- if a proxy is not working,
- if a website is not running; and
- if a SSL is not working.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # Alerts configuration.
    # Optional. Default: nil.
    :alerts => [
        # List of users to be warned.
        # Mandatory.
        :users => [
            { :name => 'Leandro Sardi', :email => 'leandro@massprospecting.com' },
        ],
        # If nil, ignore CPU usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :cpu_max_usage => 0.5, # 50%
        # If nil, ignore memory usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :mem_max_usage => 0.75, # 75%
        # If nil, ignore disk usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :dks_max_usage => 0.85, # 85%
        # If false, ignore if processes are running or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :procs => true,
        # If false, ignore if proxies are working or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :proxies => true,
        # If false, ignore if websutes are running or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :webs => true,
        # If false, ignore if SSL certificates are working or not.
        # This alert will be applicate for those webs with `:https` protocol only.
        # Optional. Default: true.

        :logs => {
            # patterns to use of it has not been defined on any node
            :default_patterns => [ /error/i, /out of/i ],
            # list of files to monitor.
            # mandatory.
            :files => [
                # monitor this file, using array of custom patterns to detect errors.
                {
                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/app.log'
                    :patterns => [/404/, /500/]
                # monitor this file, using one custom pattern to detect errors.
                }, {
                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/import.log'
                    :patterns => /CSV wrong/i
                # monitor these other files, using default patterns.
                }, {
                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/dispatcher.log'
                }, {
                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/worker.log'
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
})
```

## 19. Logging

Every command write into its own logfile.

The same outout you see in your terminal is saved into a log file.

Logfiles are located in the path you defined in the variable `$SAASLIB`

## 20. Silent Mode

Any command you run, it can be ran in `silent` mode by simply redirecting `STDOUT` and `STDERR`, and running in backend.

E.g.:

```
saas procs nodes=.* > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Running a command in silent mode allows you to launch it into a server and monitor your infrastructure 24/7 and receive an email alert as soon as an alert is raised.
