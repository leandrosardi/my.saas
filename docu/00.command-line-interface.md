## 1. The `saas` Command

The `saas` command simply receives the name of a Ruby **script** that you want to execute.

```
saas <ruby script filename>
```

The `saas` command will look for such a script into the folder specified in the environment variable `$SAASLIB`. 

If the script your call receives parameters, then you can add them.

```
saas <ruby script filename> <list of command line parameters>
```

Here is the list of scripts you can execute:

| script  | example                                       | description                                                                                                                                          |

**Logging**

Every script write into its own logfile.

The same outout you see in your terminal is saved into a log file.

Logfiles are located in the path you defined in the variable `$SAASLIB`

**Silent Mode**

Any command you run, it can be ran in `silent` mode by simply redirecting `STDOUT` and `STDERR`, and running in backend.

E.g.:

```
saas procs nodes=.* > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

Running a command in silent mode allows you to launch it into a server and monitor your infrastructure 24/7 and receive an email alert as soon as an alert is raised.

## 2. Define Nodes

This is the IaaC part.

You can add a node to your infrastructure.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'master', 

    # If true, this node is belonging your development environment.
    # If true, ignore this node when deploying.
    # Optional. Default: false.
    :dev => false, 

    # Public Internet IP address of the node.
    # If `nil`, that means that no instance of a cloud server has been created yet for this node.
    # Optional. Default: `nil`.
    :net_remote_ip => nil,

    # Who is providing this node.
    # Allowed values: [:contabo].
    # Optional. Default: :contabo.
    :provider => :contabo,

    # What service is this.
    # If :provider is :contabo, allowed values are ['CLOUD VPS 1', 'CLOUD VPS 3', 'CLOUD VPS 6']
    # Mandatory.
    :service => 'CLOUD VPS 1',

    # Reference to another node where is hosted the database to work with.
    # Mandatory.
    :db_host => 'dev2',

    # SSH credentials.
    :ssh_username => 'blackstack',
    :ssh_port => 22,
    :ssh_password => '<write SSH password here>',

    # Root password is required to install the environment at the first time.
    :ssh_root_password => '<write SSH password here>',

    # Parameters to connect to the github repositories.
    #
    :git_repository => 'leandrosardi/my.saas',
    :git_branch => 'main', 
    :git_username => 'leandrosardi',
    # Instead of GitHub password, you have to provide an access token.
    # How to get a GitHub access token: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app 
    :git_password => '<your github access token>',
    
    # Folder into where you want to clone the repository defined in `git_repository`.
    # Mandatory.
    :code_folder => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',

    # List of processes to start
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :procs => {
        # list of commands to run when starting a node.
        :start => [
            {
                # the command you are executing must be located into `code_folder`.
                :command => 'app.rb port=3000',
                # where to redirect any output in the starting of this command.
                # note that the command may log into another file once it started.
                :stdout => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/app.log',
                :stderr => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',
                # value to assign to the environment variable `$RUBYLIB`
                :rubylib => '/home/blackstack/code1/master',
            }, {
                ...
            }
        ],
        # list of commands to kill when stopping a node.
        :stop => [
            'app.rb port=3000',
            'adspower',
            ...
        ],
    },

    # List of logfiles allowed to watch or monitor.
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :logs => [
        '/home/blackstack/code1/master/app.log',
        ... 
    ],

    # List of websites published on this node.
    # This is used for monitoring.
    # Optional. Default: [].
    :webs => [
        {
            # descriptive name of this website.
            :name => 'ruby-sinatra',
            # port this website is listening.
            :port => 3000,
            # protocol used. Allowed values are [:http, :https].
            :protocol => :http,
        }, {
            # descriptive name of this website.
            :name => 'nginx',
            # port this website is listening.
            :port => 443,
            # protocol used. Allowed values are [:http, :https].
            :protocol => :https,
        }
    ],
})
```

Note that if the hash descriptor passed to the `add_node` method has not the right format, of if there are missed parameters, or if there are unknown parameters; then such a method will raise an exception `Node hash descriptor mailformed.`

## 3. Create Nodes

You can create a new instance of a cloud server for any of the nodes you have defined.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.create :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas create nodes=master
```

- If the node has been already created, the command will raise an exception.

```
saas create nodes=master
Error: Command already created.
```

- You can also request the creation all nodes using regular expressions.

```
saas create nodes=*
```

- You can also request the creation some nodes by listing them separated by commas.

```
saas create nodes=master,slave01
```

- You can do both: listing many nodes, and using regular expressions in some elements of the list.

```
saas create nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 4. Release Node

If you have manually deleted the instance of a node from your hosting provider, you can update that your database.

The `release` script simply assign `nil` value to the field `net_remote_ip`.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.release :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas create nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 5. Install

Install the my.saas envoronment into one node, by running the script `install.20.04.sh`.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.install :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas install nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 6. Deploy

This command will:

- pull the latest version of source code of my.saas from the branch specified in `git_branch`,

- pull the latest version of source code of each [extension](/docu/16.extensibility.md) specified in the `config.rb`, 

- run `bundler update`,

- execute all sql migrations in the folder `sql`,

- install SSL certification.

You can automatically perform all the operations above.

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.deploy :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas deploy nodes=master,slave.*
```

## 7. Stop

Stop a specific process or all processes running into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 8. Start

Start a specific list of processes into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 9. Restart

Restart a specific list of process into one or more nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 10. Push Secrets

Submit the secret files `config.rb` from your local environment to your secret repository.

First thing first, you have to define what are your secrets.

E.g.:

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.set_secrets({
    # define your secret repository.
    :git_repository => 'leandrosardi/my.secrets',
    :git_branch => 'main', 
    :git_username => 'leandrosardi',
    # Instead of GitHub password, you have to provide an access token.
    # How to get a GitHub access token: https://docs.github.com/en/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/generating-a-user-access-token-for-a-github-app 
    :git_password => '<your github access token>',

    # define your secret files.
    :secrets => [
        {
            # this is where you place the source code for the master node.
            #
            # representative name of this secret.
            :name => :master,
            # path in my local environment where this secret is placed.
            :path => 'home/leandro/code1/master/config.rb',
        }, {
            # this is where you place the source code for any slave node.
            #
            # representative name of this secret.
            :name => :slave,
            # path in my local environment where this secret is placed.
            :path => 'home/leandro/code1/slave/config.rb',
        }
    ]
})
```

Then,

- You can do that by Ruby code:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.push :master
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI:

```
saas push secrets=master,slave
```

Note that if the hash descriptor passed to the `set_secrets` method has not the right format, of if there are missed parameters, or if there are unknown parameters; then such a method will raise an exception `Secret hash descriptor mailformed.`

## 11. Pull Secrets

Download the secret files from your secret repository to your local environment.

## 12. Connect via SSH

Open a SSH connection to a specific node.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 13. Reboot

Reboot nodes.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 14. Procs

Show list of processes defined for each node, and show which ones are running and which ones are not.

- You can do that by Ruby code and get a hash descriptor of the **state** of each process defined for a node.

The **state** of a process indicates if such a process is running or not:


```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.procs :master
# => [{ :proc => 'app.rb port=3000', running => true }]
```

- Or you can do it with the CLI, and watch a table that will update every 5 seconds by default:

```
saas push nodes=master

| proc             | running |
|------------------|---------|
| app.rb port=3000 | yes     |
```

- You can specify the interval to update the table:

```
saas procs secrets=master interval=10
```

- You can also specify the processes you want to watch using regular expression:

```
saas procs secrets=master procs=app
```

- Obviously, you can specify a list of many nodes and many processes to watch:

```
saas procs secrets=master,slave.* procs=app,import,timeline
```

## 15. Log

Watch one log of the ones defined for a nodes, and watch it.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 16. Stat

Watch the usage of CPU, memory, and disk space of each node if your infrastructure.

_complete the rest of documentation__

## 17. Proxies

Show list of proxies defined for each node, and show which ones are running and which ones are not.

For using this feature, you have to define the proxies configured on a node.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # List of proxies installed.
    # Optional. Default: nil.
    :proxies => {
        # define username and password for all proxies.
        :default_username => 'proxy-user-01',
        :default_password => '<password for all proxies here>',
        # list of proxies.
        # Mandatory.
        :ports => [
            # you can define a specific port with specific credentials.
            { :numbers => 3000, :username => 'custom-user', :password => '<custom password>' },
            # you can define an array of ports that use default credentials.
            # note that you are converting a rnage into an array.
            { :numbers => [3001..3250].to_a },
        ]
    }
})
```

## 20. Alerts

When you define a node, you can setup the following alerts:

- if CPU usage is over a threshold,
- if memory usage is over a threshold,
- if disk usage is under a threshold,
- if a log file contains certain strings or string patterns,
- if a process is not running,
- if a proxy is not working,
- if a website is not running; and
- if a SSL is not working.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # Alerts configuration.
    # Optional. Default: nil.
    :alerts => [
        # List of users to be warned.
        # Mandatory.
        :users => [
            { :name => 'Leandro Sardi', :email => 'leandro@massprospecting.com' },
        ],
        # If nil, ignore CPU usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :cpu_max_usage => 0.5, # 50%
        # If nil, ignore memory usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :mem_max_usage => 0.75, # 75%
        # If nil, ignore disk usage.
        # Optional. Default: nil.
        :dks_max_usage => 0.85, # 85%
        # If false, ignore if processes are running or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :procs => true,
        # If false, ignore if proxies are working or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :proxies => true,
        # If false, ignore if websutes are running or not.
        # Optional. Default: true.
        :webs => true,
        # If false, ignore if SSL certificates are working or not.
        # This alert will be applicate for those webs with `:https` protocol only.
        # Optional. Default: true.

                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/import.log'
                    :patterns => /CSV wrong/i
                # monitor these other files, using default patterns.
                }, {
                    :filename => '/home/blackstack/code1/master/dispatcher.log'
                # monitor all those files that match with a pattern.

## 21. Custom Installation Snippets

By default, the `install` script execute our [standard environment installation](https://github.com/leandrosardi/environment).

In some cases, you may want to run with other environment. E.g.: When we are running a proxies server.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # Custom Snippet for Environment Installation.
    :install => Proc.new do |node, logger, *args|
        # ...
    end

})
```

## 22. Custom Deployment Snippets

By default, the `deploy` script will:

- pull the latest version of source code of my.saas from the branch specified in `git_branch`,

- pull the latest version of source code of each [extension](/docu/16.extensibility.md) specified in the `config.rb`, 

- run `bundler update`,

- execute all sql migrations in the folder `sql`; and

- install SSL certification.

In some cases, you may want to run a custom deployment. E.g.: When you are running [worker nodes](/docu/00.reference-architectures.md#master-slave-worker-architecture); who don't need to install my.saas, but they need to run custom processing scripts instead.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    # Custom Snippet for Deployment.
    :deploy => Proc.new do |node, logger, *args|
        # ...
    end

})
```

## 23. Custom Alerts Snippets

You can define a custom function that returns a string with an alert description; or returns `nil` that there is not an alert.

Use **custom alerts** to raise custom alerts that are specific to the business.

E.g.: Failed payments processing.

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_node({
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'proxy-server-01', 

    ...

    :alerts => [
        # List of users to be warned.
        # Mandatory.
        :users => [
            { :name => 'Leandro Sardi', :email => 'leandro@massprospecting.com' },
        ],

        ...

        # Array of Custom Alert Snippets.
        # Optional. Default: [].
        # 
        :snippets => [
            {
                # descriptive name of the custom alert
                :name => 'Failed payment processing',

                # function that returns `nil` if there is no an alert to warn the users.
                # otherwise, it returns a string with a description of the problem to warn the users.
                :func => Proc.new do |node, logger, *args|
                    # ...
                end,
            },
        ],    
    ]
})

## 24. Distributed Monitoring

As long as your infrastructure grows, you cannot monitor all nodes with one stand-alone process.

E.g.: The command

```
saas procs nodes=.* interval=30 > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

should run every 30 seconds. But if your list of nodes is too long, every run may take more than 30 seconds.

To distribute the monitoring of nodes altrough processes, and even altrough many servers, you have to 

1. define nodes that will be used for monitoring,

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.add_nodes([{
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'monitor-01', 
    
    ...

}, {
    # Unique name to identify a host (a.k.a.: node).
    # It is equal to the hostname of the node.
    # Mandatory.
    :name => 'monitor-02', 
    
    ...

}, {

    ...

}])
```

2. define what are the nodes used for monitoring,

```ruby
BlackStack::IaaC.set_monitoring({
    # max number of processes allowed in a node.
    :default_max_procs => 150,
    # list of nodes used for monitoring.
    :nodes => [
        # assign a node for monitoring, using the default number of `max_procs`.
        { :name => 'monitor-01' },
        # assign a node for monitoring, with a custom number of `max_procs`.
        { :name => 'monitor-02', :max_procs => 250 },
    ]
})
```

and 

3. run the `assign` script:

```ruby
saas assign
```

The `assign` script will 

- assign one monitoring node to each node; and

- add the necessary processes (`:procs`) and log files (`:logs`) for the monitoring of such a node.

Note that for each node that you are monitoring, you launch:

- one single `proces` process,
- one single `web` process,
- one single `ssl` process,
- one single `stat` process,
- one single `proxies` process,
- one `log` process for each log file in the node.
