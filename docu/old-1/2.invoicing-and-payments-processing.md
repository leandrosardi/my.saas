# 2. Invoicing and Payments Processing

**MySaaS** is extensible. That means, you can install 3th parties extensions to add features like payments processing; or any other extension regarding the kind of product that you want to develop like e-commerce, online stores, software-as-a-service, education, social networks, etc.

If the extension you need doesn't exists, you can create your own extensions too.

Installing a extension is as simple as running a Ruby script:

```bash
cd ~/mysaas
ruby ./add.rb name=<extension name>
```
