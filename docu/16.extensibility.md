## 1. Folders Structure

Basically, an extension is a folder structure that is appended to the **MySaaS** platform.

**E.g.:**

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::appened :helpdesk
# this line will append all the subfolders into ~/code/helpdesk to ~/code/my.saas
```

You can also custom some default values of the extension.

**E.g.:**

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::appened :helpdesk, { :show_in_top_bar => SANDBOX, :show_in_footer => SANDBOX, :show_in_dashboard => SANDBOX }
```

The folder structure is well defined [here](./folders-structure.md).

An extension can include one or more of these components:

1. screens,
2. ruby libraries,
3. javascript libraries,
4. style sheets,
5. sql scripts,
6. [skeleton and stub](https://github.com/leandrosardi/mysaas/blob/main/docu/design-patterns.md) classes.

## 2. Extension Descriptors

Any extension have a file `extension.rb` in its root path, with a hash descriptor.

**Example:**

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'helpdesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a MySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'
)
```

## 3. Versioning

When you write the descriptor of an extension, you can define what is the version of such an extension.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'chatjs',
    :description => 'Javascript widget to add messaging boxes to your apps.'

    # define version with format <mayor>.<minor>.<revision>
    :version => '1.2.54',
)
```

## 4. Dependenices

When you write the descriptor of an extension, you can define what other extensions are needed to run such an extension.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a MySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.',
    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',
    # define version with format <mayor>.<minor>.<revision>
    :dependencies => [
        { :extension => :chatjs, :version => '1.2.54' },
    ],
)
```

## 5. Adding Extensions as Modules of Your SaaS

Your extension may be shown to the end-user as a module of your platform.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a MySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.',
    # define the name of the author
    :author => 'leandrosardi',
    # what is the section to add this extension in either the top-bar, the footer, the dashboard.
    :services_section => 'Marketplace',
    # show this extension as a service in the top bar?
    :show_in_top_bar => true,
    # show this extension as a service in the footer?
    :show_in_footer => true,
    # show this extension as a service in the dashboard?
    :show_in_dashboard => true,
    # what are the screens to add in the leftbar
    :leftbar_icons => [
        # add an icon with the label "dashboard`, with the icon `icon-dashboard`, and poiting to the scren `helpdesk/dashboard`. 
        { :label => 'search', :icon => :'icon-search', :screen => :search, },
        # add an icon with the label "tickets`, with the icon `icon-envelope`, and poiting to the scren `helpdesk/tickets`. 
        { :label => 'exports', :icon => :'icon-download-cloud', :screen => :exports, },
    ],
)
```

## 6. Adding Extensions as Settings Screens

Your extension may add screens to the accounts settings.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'Infoicing and Payments Processing (I2P)',
    :description => 'I2P is a MySaaS extension for end-user creating invoices and show consumption transactions into your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where its files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'i2p',

    # add some screens of this extension to the account settings of your SaaS.
    :setting_screens => [
        # add a link in section `Billing & Finances` of the `/settings` screen, with a caption `Invoices`, and linking to the screen `/settings/invoices`. The source code of the screen `/settings/invoices` is copied from the file `/vews/invoices.erb` in the extension's folder. 
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'Invoices', :screen => :invoices }
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'PayPal Subscriptions', :screen => :subscriptions }
        { :section => 'Billing & Finances', :label => 'Transactions', :screen => :transactions }
    ],
)
```

## 7. Expanding the Account Storage Folder

Each account has a dedicated [storage](./1.accounts-management.md#17-account-files-storage) where to store private files.

Each exgension can add some specific folders to for the accounts storage.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a MySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where these files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',

    # add a folder to the storage where user can upload files and screenshots with his/her tickets.
    :storage_folders => [
        { :name => 'files' }, 
        { :name => 'screenshots' },
    ]
)
```

## 8. Adding Deployment Routines

When you run the MySaaS's command `deploy.rb`, it will look for deployment routines in the extensions, just after restarting the webserver.

Each extension can add its own deployment routines.

For example, you may want to start some daemon for an offline procesing.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'HelpDesk',
    :description => 'HelpDesk is a MySaaS extension to add basic tickets support for your SaaS.'

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where these files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'helpdesk',

    # deployment routines
    :deployment_routines => [{
        :name => 'start-export-process',
        :commands => [{ 
            # back up old configuration file
            # setup new configuration file
            :command => "
                source /home/%ssh_username%/.rvm/scripts/rvm; rvm install 3.1.2; rvm --default use 3.1.2;
                cd /home/%ssh_username%/code/mysaas/extensions/helpdesk/p; 
                export RUBYLIB=/home/%ssh_username%/code;
                nohup ruby export.rb;
            ",
            :sudo => false,
            :background => true,
        }],
    }],
)
```

## 9. Adding CSS Files

Into the folders structure of your extension, place all the css files into the folder `/my-extension/public/css`.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'my-extension',
    :description => 'Example of an extensions for adding css files.',

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where these files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'my-extension',

    # define JS files to add to the header of every page
    :css_files => [
        '/my-extension/css/my-script.js',
    ],
)
```

## 10. Adding JavaScript Files

Into the folders structure of your extension, place all the javascripts files into the folder `/my-extension/public/javascirpts`.

```ruby
BlackStack::Extensions::add(
    # descriptive name and descriptor
    :name => 'my-extension',
    :description => 'Example of an extensions for adding javascript files.',

    # this is the name of the sub-folders where these files will be stored.
    # examples: `p/helpdesk`, `cli/helpdesk`, `models/helpdesk`, `views/helpdesk`, etc. 
    :folder => 'my-extension',

    # define JS files to add to the header of every page
    :js_files => [
        '/my-extension/javascript/my-script.js',
    ],
)
```
